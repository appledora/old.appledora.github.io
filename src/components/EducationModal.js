          in <i>September, 2021.</i> My earlier journey in the university was
          not very smooth - I was very mentally distraught and{" "}
          <b>couldn't focus for around TWO YEARS</b>. For the first 4 semesters,
          my CGPA kept fluctuating around a bare minimum 3.4. However, when
          dangerous accident rendered me <b>bed-ridden for over 6 months</b> I
          managed to rekindle my enthusiasm for studying. I participated in all
          sorts of activities as soon as I managed to join my class, all the
          while getting high scores in all the tests and labs. The radical
          change in my love for hardwork and knowledge is{" "}

            Across two semesters, my team and I completed <b>double-thesis </b>
            from different domains, under the supervision of{" "}

            (published in two conference workshops). The second thesis was in
            the Bioinformatics field. This is an on-going work where we try to

              interpret the usability of transformer based models in
              identification of IGHV Î² - cells

            DistilBERT) to find linguistic patterns in RNA sequences and
            validating their biological significance through language modeling.{" "}
